# specialization-capstone

Before I ever decided to get into the Tech space? 
I was always testing/critiquing sites & thinking how I would make them better or what changes I would make to enhance the sites functionality. 
I never even knew people made a living out of it! 
Now I find myself potentially on the doorstep of being able to do exactly that! 

QA was something I never considered prior to Devmountain & was something I didn't even know existed. 
But once I heard the Perficient employees present their Day to Day lives in QA? 
I knew it was exactly where I belonged.

Fast forward to my capstone project. 
I chose to test both automatically & manually eBay & Yoox. 
Two sites I am pretty familiar with and the reason I chose these two sites? 
Is their ability to frustrate me. 
I always seek challenges, so the opportunity to test two sites which have given me issues in the past was an easy decision for me. 

In my manual test I noted both the bugs/defects I came across with both sites. I
I proceeded to test both sites on their: 
menus, features, buttons, functionality, shopping, buying, carts, checkout processes, login, username, password, homepages, user customized pages. 
The entire process was an intense learning process. 
I learned so much about the sites, as well as about the testing process overall. 
I garnered an entirely new appreciation for those who built the sites, as well as for those who spend their time testing sites for the optimal customer experience.
